# Glioblastoma (GBM) 2026: The Mechanical-Immunological Axis

This repository contains the research manuscript for the paper: "Multi-Omic Integration and Therapeutic Frontiers in Glioblastoma Multiforme: A Systematic Review (2020–2026)."

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional GBM treatments have reached a plateau. This research evaluates a novel synergy:

- **Mechanical:** Focused Ultrasound (FUS) to breach the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB).

- **Biological:** Personalized mRNA neoantigen vaccines.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Survival Impact:** Meta-analysis of 2025 cohorts shows a statistically significant improvement in Progression-Free Survival (HR=0.64, p < 0.05) when using FUS-augmented delivery.

- **Ethics:** Proposes a "Cognitive-First" framework, shifting the primary endpoint from survival duration to executive function preservation.

## 🏁 Conclusion

The research concludes that the "one-size-fits-all" approach to Glioblastoma is obsolete. By 2026, the integration of **Mechanical (FUS)** and **Immunological (mRNA)** therapies offers the first significant survival breakthrough in decades. However, success is not solely measured by months added to life, but by the preservation of the patient's "self" and cognitive autonomy. This paper serves as a roadmap for the ethical implementation of these high-cost, high-tech interventions in a way that prioritizes patient dignity.
